        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Roasted chicken never fails to impress, but it's surprisingly simple to make! This juicy roasted chicken recipe is perfect for beginner cooks and old pros alike.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>1 (3 pound) <strong>whole chicken</strong>, giblets removed</li>
            <li><strong>salt</strong> and <strong>black pepper</strong> to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>onion powder</strong>, or to taste</li>
            <li>Â½ cup <strong>butter</strong></li>
            <li>1 stalk <strong>celery</strong>, leaves removed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the outside of chicken. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
