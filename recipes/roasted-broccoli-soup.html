        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Blend roasted broccoli, cream cheese, and vegetable broth to make a simple, yet delicious soup. Roasting broccoli enhances its flavor, allowing nutty and sweet flavors to develop.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>5 cups chopped <strong>broccoli florets and stalks</strong></li>
            <li>1 <strong>onion</strong>, chopped into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, peeled</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons <strong>olive oil</strong></li>
            <li>3 cups <strong>vegetable broth</strong></li>
            <li>4 ounces <strong>cream cheese</strong>, softened</li>
            <li>Â¾ teaspoon <strong>lemon pepper</strong>, or more as needed</li>
